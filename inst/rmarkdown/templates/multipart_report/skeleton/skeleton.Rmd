# Using this template
## Basics
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
data(mtcars)
```

## Figures and Figure labels
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r examplePlot, fig.cap="An example plot", format='interactive'}
carFig <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, colour=cyl, text=rownames(mtcars))) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
plotMD(carFig)
```

Note that a figure label (by default this is *Figure N*) is added to the figure caption when the plot is included in the output.
This plot can be referenced in the text including a call to the `figRef` function using the the chunk label as its only
argument. This is a reference to `r figRef('examplePlot')`. The *reportMD* package supports the use of interactive plots 
in HTML pages (generated with [*plotly*](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly)) as well static versions. This feature relies on
the use of *ggplot2* for plotting. Using the *plotMD* function to produce the plot from a *grob* prepared earlier allows
seamless switching between the two by setting the `format` option, either globally (in the YAML frontmatter or in the 
call to *render*) or for an individual chunk.

```{r staticPlot, fig.cap=paste("Static version of", figRef('examplePlot'))}
carFig <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, colour=cyl, text=rownames(mtcars))) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
plotMD(carFig)
```

It is also possible to link to a figure in a child document by providing the corresponding label
from the list of dependencies to indicate the target file: `r figRef('boxplot', target='part2')`.

## Tables
Tables can be added to the output document by printing a `data.frame` or `matrix` using *printMD*.

```{r carTable, tab.cap="A subset of the *mtcars* dataset."}
printMD(mtcars[1:5, c('mpg', 'hp', 'cyl')])
```

Tables can be referenced in the same way as figures, using the *tabRef* function. This is a reference to `r tabRef('carTable')`.

## Using R objects from child documents
Your R chunks may use objects created by a chunk in a different (child) document, provided the generating chunk is cached 
and the cache is available when this document is knitted. To do this simply list the path to the child document in the
YAML header under `params: depends` (note the `value` field required by *knitr*):

```yaml
params:
  depends:
    value:
      part1: part1.Rmd
```

This will load all R objects generated by cached chunks in *part1.Rmd* into the environment in which the chunks of this
document are evaluated. To only load a subset of chunks from the child document, provide a list of chunk labels:

```yaml
params: 
  depends:
    value:
      part2: 
        part2.Rmd: [regression, prepRegPlot]
```

As a result we have direct access to the R objects created in the child documents and can use them in the main
document in whatever order is most useful to explain the analysis and discuss the results. In *part2.Rmd*
we constructed a ggplot and cached the resulting object. This can now be used to produce the plot here.

```{r regression, dependson=c('part2:regression', 'part2:prepRegPlot'), fig.cap="Linear regression result. Car weight is a good predictor for MPG and the US built cars in the dataset tend to be heavier."}
plotMD(reg_fig)
```

In addition to specifying all chunks to import from a child document it is also possible to specify required
chunks as part of the *dependson* chunk option by providing dependencies of the form '`child label`:`chunk label`'.
For example, to load the *regression* chunk from *part2.Rmd* (to which we have assigned the label *part2*) we
could add `dependson='part2:regression'` to the chunk options. This has the advantage that dependencies are managed
for each chunk, making it easier to update dependencies as the requirements of a code chunk change. It also makes
it more explicit where objects in a code chunk come from.

## Linking to child documents
It may be useful to add links to the child documents in appropriate places throughout the text. This can
be achieved using *pandoc*'s reference link syntax. For example, to link to [Part 2][part2] simply use `[some text][part2]`.
