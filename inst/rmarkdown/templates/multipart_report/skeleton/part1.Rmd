# Introduction

This is the first part of an example data analysis. In this example we'll do some basic
data pre-processing and then export the dataset for use in the downstream analysis.

We'll use the (outdated and not very exciting) *mtcars* dataset for this analysis.
This consists of `r ncol(mtcars)` variables for `r nrow(mtcars)` car models build
in 1973 and 1974. It looks something like this:

```{r mtcarsHead}
printMD(head(mtcars))
```

The only thing we'll do for the purpose of this example is to add an additional 
column to indicate whether the car was build in the US or elsewhere.

```{r origin}
international <- c(1:3, 8:14, 18:21, 26:28, 30:32)
ext_cars <- mtcars
ext_cars$origin <- 'US'
ext_cars$origin[international] <- 'international'
```


```{r appendix, child='rmd/appendix.Rmd'}
```
