# Analysis
This is the second part of the multi-part data analysis document. Here we'll use
the pre-processed dataset produced in [Part 1][part1] for a basic analysis.

```{r prepBoxplot, dependson='part1:origin'}
box_fig <- ggplot(ext_cars, aes(x=origin, y=mpg)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()
```

An initial look at the data suggests that there is a pronounced difference
in the miles per gallon achieved by US and international cars (`r figRef("boxplot")`). 

```{r boxplot, fig.cap="Boxplot of MPG for US and internationally build cars."}
plotMD(box_fig)
```

A reasonable initial hypothesis for why this might be the case is that US built
cars may tend to be larger (and therefore heavier) and have larger engines.
As it turns out car weight and engine displacement are highly correlated 
($\rho$ = `r cor(mtcars$disp, mtcars$wt)`), so we'll
investigate this by fitting a linear regression model with weight as
explanatory variable.

```{r regression, dependson='part1:origin'}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data=ext_cars)
ext_cars$fitted <- fit$fitted.values
```

This appears to explain the difference in MPG reasonably well, although
it is clearly not the only relevant factor:

```{r reg_table}
printMD(fit)
```

We'll also prepare a plot visualising the result for inclusion in the main document.

```{r prepRegPlot, dependson='regression'}
reg_fig <- ggplot(ext_cars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, colour=origin, text=rownames(ext_cars))) + geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_abline(slope=fit$coefficients['wt'], intercept=fit$coefficients[1], linetype='dashed', colour='darkgrey') +
  geom_segment(aes(yend=fitted, xend=(fitted-fit$coefficients[1])/fit$coefficients['wt'])) +
  theme_bw()
```

Just to let you know - MathJax does work with this custom template so you can insert any LaTeX expression you want.  
Here we just use a random formula to demonstrate that everything is working. Check [this link](http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/courses/m343/F12/RStudio/LatexExamples.html) for a briew overview of basic LaTeX commands.
